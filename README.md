# .dotfiles 

This is my personal collection of dotfiles, covering my personal configs for my
main tools (primarily git, emacs, fish, and my terminal prompt). Files are
managed using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

There are several blogs posts out there about how to manage your dotfiles using
stow, but I personally found these two very helpful:
